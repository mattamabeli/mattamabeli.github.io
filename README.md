personal website using github with pages

*Now I just need to get this to work with something other than a ReadMe...* ;)

## Sub Heading test  
Now I need to learn markdown...

And for a few things to do...  
  * handle lists  
  * figure out how to make this work with index.hmtl  
       - cleaner for code pushes  
  * figure out how to push new pages

check out my probably empty [website...](http://www.mattamabeli.com)
